      <h2>Hello.</h2>

        <h3>Flying</h3>
        <p>My childhood dream was to become a pilot and the biggest inspiration into me becoming one was my late dad. The desire to feel like a flying human or superhero with superpowers made me jump for joy, it was my first love and forever it will be.</p>

        <h3>Problem Solver</h3>
        <p>Since I could remember how to walk, I was always a query kid that questions and attempts to solve problems that I've faced in my day to day basis, nothing beats the satisfaction feeling you get when solving problems, just makes me crave it more and more.</p>

        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <p>Joy and skills from cooking came down from my mom amounting to the time that she and I share in the kitchen cooking up food for the family. I was apparently dubbed <i>best cook</i> by my friends when we were in aviation school. </p>
